                    <h2>Hey! I am Lu√≠sa</h2>
                    <p>I am a front-end developer who loves to create things
                    using React.js, JavaScript and CSS. I also have been
                    learning some UX Design and another passion of mine is
                    to write and try to make the world a better place through
                    my words. Finally, I am an assumed foodie (addicted to
                     chocolate, pasta and coffee) and travel enthusiast.</p>

                    <h2>Content Marketing</h2>
                    <p>When I worked as a marketing manager, I wrote many articles
                    targeting the audience that included potential customers to the
                    software that the startup was developing.
