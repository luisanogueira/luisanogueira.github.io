                    <p>I am a front-end developer who loves to create things
                    using React.js, JavaScript and CSS. I also have been
                    learning some UX Design and another passion of mine is
                    to write and try to make the world a better place through
                    my words. Finally, I am an assumed foodie (addicted to
                     chocolate, pasta and coffee) and travel enthusiast.</p>

                    <p>When I worked as a marketing manager, I wrote many articles
                    targeting the audience that included potential customers to the
                    software that the startup was developing.

                    <p>I volunteered to work with content creation on United Nations
                    Volunteers, and wrote some articles related to education for <a

                    organization. Two of those articles were published on their blog, so it

                    target="_blank">Instituto Marielle Franco</a> in Brazil, had on their webside
                    a table where data about candidates for the next elections that support
                    their inclusive agenda was displayed; however, they needed a filter that
                    would allow users to search for more specific criteria, and I volunteered
                    to help! I created this filter and you can see it

                    </p>
                    <p>In the end, we all decided it would be a better user experience to
                        display the data in a list format, and let the user filter by region
                        with a dropdown, which other volunteers of the project took care of.
                        This project was an amazing experience for me! Here is the
